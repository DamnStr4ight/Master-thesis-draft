\section{Constraints}

As the thesis is written in cooperation with Microchip Technology inc., it comes with the expectation that all microcontrollers should be Atmel AVR's, the main focus of the Tiller sight as of spring 2018. Further more these microcontrolles should be as new as possible

For the RFID circuit, it is preferred that no operational amplifiers are used, as far as physics allows it, use as few active components as possible.
