\section{Motivation}
In the electronics sector as a whole, cutting cost is a huge part of staying competitive. If you can save a component on the Bill of Materials (BOM) you should do so. Another benefit of having fewer components on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is that it frees up area, effectivly freing up space for other functions, sensors or the like. Alternatively one could make the whole PCB, and in turn the product smaller, which is in many cases also preferable, and may lower cost.
