\chapter{Future Work}
What more can we implement? Is there something more that would be a nice addition to this project?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Check if smaller coils gives a strong enough field to read through 3.6mm plywood while still undetectable by other coils, lowering total board read time to around 50ms.
    \item Implement a timer module to keep track of time for each player.
    \item If possible make the board according to FIDE standards.
    \item Use Stockfish to verify moves, this is compatible with the FEN notation, so it should not be too much work.
\end{itemize}
